# GAN_s  
Gans is simple pytorch library for training GANs. This library is based on [pytorch](https://pytorch.org/) and [ignite]( https://pytorch.org/ignite/) library.


## pre-requisites

Gans takes huge amounts of computaional recourses . So it its heighly encarages to use torch gpu version 

1. create env using conda

conda activate gans
```

3. install requirements
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


1. torch >= 1.4.0
2. cuda == 11.8
